# Cloud Computing:

- The **_cloud computing_** is a technology that allows us to use computing services using Internet instead of local storage of user's computer. 
- These servers are present at the data-centers worldwide. This provides us access to these servers from almost any device as the computing and data storage doesn't take place locally. 
- By using cloud computing, users can rent resources on-demand from the cloud-service providers. The management of physical servers and software applications is done by these service providers. 
- The user is only charged for using the service as per pay-as-you-go model. 
- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are some of the well known cloud-service providers.
