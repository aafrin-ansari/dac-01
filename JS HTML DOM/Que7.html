<title>P Tag</title>

20th July,2015</br></br>
<p>
Each day a bright one,</br>
Followed by the good old Sun.</br>
While nature's joy swells up to the skies,</br>
"Oh it's morning already!" our worked up world sighs.</br></br>
</p>
<p>
Slowly the chirps and chaos begin to fade,</br>
The busy bees get along with the life they have made.</br>
Treating their young ones with love and care,</br>
Oh look, there is the mother dove.</br></br>
</p>
<p>
The day goes by and the evening comes</br>
The sharpness of the old Sun is now blunt</br>
The waves keep making the sea foam</br>
And all are now heading to home.</br></br>
</p>
<p>
And by the time a baby sparrow got lost,</br>
Some of his mates flew down to the Aust.</br>
Not everyone has returned home happy and bright,</br>
Few sailed through while few lost the light.</br></br>
</p>
<p>
But won't the Sun turn again full bright?</br>
Nothing stays permamently out of light.</br>
The flora, the fauna welcomes it with joy and pride!</br>
"Oh it's morning again!" But the humans sigh.</br></br>
