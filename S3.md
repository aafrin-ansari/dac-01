## <ins>Simple Storage Service _(S3)_:</ins>

- It's basically a storage engine.
- It uses a concept of _**bucket**_ which is similar to _folders_. It is posiible to create a bucket within a bucket and so on.
- While creating a parent bucket, the name must be _globally unique_ across AWS S3.
- Once created, the user can upload files or create a bucket in that bucket.
- It seems like it is similar to cloud storage such as Google Drive but it's not just limited to storage.
- S3 provides high scalability, security and performance.
- It's simple interface allows the user to store or retrieve any amount of data anytime, anywhere using internet.
- The user can allow multiple access to such buckets. Uploading/Downloading permissions can be granted or denied to others as per requirement.

### Creating a bucket in AWS:

On the AWS Management Console, click on the **Services** menu. Select **S3** from **Storage** section. **Storage** section is also available on the dashboard itself. One can also search **S3** directly from the _Search bar_ provided on the dashboard.
